# C++ calculator project

This projet was meant for learning C++ and OOP.
It consists in a  Reverse Polish Notation calculator with the following features :
* A stack of de litterals on which to act with operators, dynamically managed so has to use UNDO et REDO
* A way to write expressions in their regular form (not reverse polish) and evaluate them
* A way to write and save programs (list of numbers and operators) and variables
* A way to save them in texdt files and load theme

Its structure is so that is it easy to add other features, and more specifically different operators.
Some finishing touches are still required. The Qt interface is incomplete and there are no exception handling.
It was however very interesting to conceptualize and develop.
